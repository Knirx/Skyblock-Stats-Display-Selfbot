# Skyblock-Stats-Selfbot

**A Discord Selfbot that allows you to display stats of skyblock Players using the !stats [ign] command!**

**This requires a [Hypixel API Key](https://developer.hypixel.net) and the Skyhelper API. You can find the unfixed Skyhelper API [here](https://github.com/Altpapier/SkyHelperAPI), if you want the fixed one DM @realonur on Discord**

## Setup

**You only need to setup the .env file, after finishing make sure to install the requirements.txt**

**Make sure you have the metadata.js running so you are able to display the stats!**
